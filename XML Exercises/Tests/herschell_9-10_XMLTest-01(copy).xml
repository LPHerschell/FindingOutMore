        <p>Most of the <orgName>XML Working Groups</orgName> have been closed by now; this year saw <orgName type="workGroup">XQuery</orgName> and <orgName type="workGroup">XSLT</orgName>
            close, their work successfully completed.
        <p>As we wind down work on standardizing the XML stack at <orgName>W3C</orgName> it’s worth looking at some of
            what we have accomplished and why. <codeLang>W3C XML, the Extensible Markup Language</codeLang>, is one of
            the world’s most widely-used formats for representing and exchanging information. The
            final <codeLang type="stack">XML stack<codeLang/> is more powerful and easier to work with than many people know,
            especially for people who might not have used XML since its early days.<p>
        <p>Thank you to all who have contributed.</p>
        <p><author>Liam Quin</author>, leaving <orgName>W3C</orgName> this week after <duration quantity="17" unit="year">almost 17 years with <orgName type="workGroup">XML</duration></orgName>.</p>
